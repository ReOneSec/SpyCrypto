‚ú® Core Features
SpyCrypto is more than just a spam filter. It's a full moderation suite designed for modern community management.
| Icon | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| üõ°Ô∏è | Multi-Chain Detection | Utilizes a comprehensive library of regex patterns to identify a vast range of crypto wallet addresses, preventing beggars and scammers. |
| ‚úçÔ∏è | Edited Message Scanning | Spammers can't evade the bot by editing their messages after posting. SpyCrypto re-scans all edited content to ensure nothing slips through. |
| ‚öñÔ∏è | Progressive Strike System | Applies progressively severe punishments (Warn ‚û°Ô∏è Mute ‚û°Ô∏è Ban) for repeat offenders, ensuring fair moderation. Data is stored persistently in MongoDB. |
| üîó | Unauthorized Link Filtering | Automatically removes messages containing URLs or text links from non-admin users, a primary vector for scams and phishing attacks. |
| üëë | Admin & Owner Immunity | Group administrators and the owner are completely ignored by the bot, allowing them to communicate and share important links freely without interference. |
| üìä | On-Demand Statistics | Admins can get a quick report of the bot's moderation actions over the last 7 days directly in the chat using the /stats command. |

üöÄ Getting Started: A 5-Minute Guide
Deploying your own instance of SpyCrypto is simple.
Step 1: Prerequisites
 * Python 3.9+
 * A MongoDB Atlas account (free tier is sufficient).
 * A Telegram Bot Token from @BotFather.
Step 2: Clone & Install
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Configure Your Bot
Create a .env file in the main directory and fill it with your credentials.
# --- Telegram Bot Configuration ---
# Get this token from @BotFather on Telegram.
TELEGRAM_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN_HERE"

# --- Database Configuration ---
# Get this from your MongoDB Atlas dashboard ("Connect your application").
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# --- (Optional) Admin Logging ---
# The ID of the private channel for logs. Must start with a hyphen (-).
ADMIN_LOG_CHANNEL="-100123456789"

python3 bot.py
