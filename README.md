‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The bot follows a logical flow for every message it sees, ensuring fair and accurate moderation.
 * Message Received: A new message is posted or an existing one is edited.
 * Admin Check: The bot checks if the author is a group admin or owner. If so, the message is ignored.
 * Content Analysis: The message is scanned for violations:
   * Cryptocurrency addresses.
   * URLs or text links.
 * Violation Found:
   * The offending message is immediately deleted.
   * The user's strike count is retrieved from the MongoDB database.
 * Action Taken: Based on the new strike count, the bot applies a punishment (Warn, Mute, or Ban).
 * Logging: A detailed log of the action is sent to the private admin channel.
