# SpyCrypto Moderation Bot üõ°Ô∏è

A powerful and intelligent Telegram moderation bot designed to keep your crypto-focused groups clean. It automatically detects and removes spammy messages, specializing in cryptocurrency wallet addresses and unauthorized links.

This bot uses a progressive 3-strike system to warn, mute, and finally ban persistent spammers, all while logging actions to a private admin channel.

## Features

* **Crypto Address Detection**: Automatically detects and removes messages containing wallet addresses from dozens of popular blockchains.
* **Link Removal**: Instantly deletes messages from new users that contain URLs or text links.
* **3-Strike System**: A progressive punishment system to handle offenders fairly but firmly.
* **Admin Whitelisting**: All group owners and administrators are automatically ignored by the spam filters.
* **Statistics**: An admin-only `/stats` command to see moderation actions over the last 7 days.
* **Private Logging**: Logs all actions (warnings, mutes, bans) to a designated admin channel for review.
* **Persistent Storage**: Uses MongoDB to track user strikes and log moderation history.

## How It Works: The 3-Strike System

The bot tracks offenses on a per-user, per-group basis.

1.  **Strike 1: Warn** ‚ö†Ô∏è
    * The offending message is deleted.
    * The bot sends a public warning message, tagging the user.

2.  **Strike 2: Mute** üîá
    * The offending message is deleted.
    * The user is muted in the group for **24 hours**.

3.  **Strike 3: Ban** üö´
    * The offending message is deleted.
    * The user is **permanently banned** from the group.
